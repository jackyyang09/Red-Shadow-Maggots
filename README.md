This project was originally developed as part of TF2 Map's 2020 72hr Content Jam.  The jam build contains a limited amount of functionality and can be found [here](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/red-shadow-maggots-fan-game.10289/). A more complete version of the game with a more fleshed out combat system, animations and visual effects shall be released soon-ish!
