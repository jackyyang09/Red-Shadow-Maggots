What is this:

- Drag and drop reordering of Unity Event listeners in the inspector
- Gives easy access to private, internal, and obsolete methods/properties that Unity usually hides
- Allows editing of multiple of the same component type on the same object
- Provides an Invoke button on each event which executes the methods in the list (make sure you are in play mode if they are runtime only!)
- Adds hotkeys for editing events; hotkeys added are Add (Ctrl+A), Copy, Cut, Paste, Delete, and Duplicate
