This is a beta version of MPUIKit. Please note that it is expected to have bugs and not recommended for production use yet. Please report to me any issues you find through the email or post in the unity forum thread, I am actively working on it to solve your issues, implement features and provide support so I can soon make the product solid and ready for production.

Thanks for purchasing MPUIKit while it's still in beta. I appreciate your feedback and support.
 
For any further queries, feel free to email me.
